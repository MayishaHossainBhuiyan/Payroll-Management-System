# Payroll-Management-System
This was my first Java project, developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system helps manage employee details and their salaries in an organized way. It can store employee information, calculate payroll, and generate salary records.
Through this project, I learned the basics of Java, classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation, while applying OOP principles to solve a real-world problem.
